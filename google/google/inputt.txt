Movie is slow\nat places even belonging to the action drama romantic genre. Climax is\nforced because of adaptation. Love scenes are best as usual. Director\nhas given his 200% to conceiving the visuals that he couldn't give his\n100% to the emotions. Characters are not well established. A women, who\nis able to remove bullet from her most loved one person's dead body,\npossess soft heart!! How!? A person goes to the deadly enemy's house\nwithout proper disguise or any other precautions. Even , he can intrude\nwith the help of a tree trunk.Guns are the most common things between\nthem but in pre climax they fight with swords! Main male lead body is\ndeliberately over exposed, which doesn't go well with the premise of\nthe movie, where rest of the person prefers to cover themselves.\nPerformance wise Ranveer Singh is OK but lacks in most of the emotional\nscenes. Deepika Padukone is adorable. He slaves you to look at herself\nin every frame. Ratna Pathak is impressive. Richa Chaddha is fine.\nMusic by director himself is OK but lyrics by Siddharth-Garima is very\ngood.\n"], "movie_link": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215477/?ref_=nm_knf_i1", "review_data3": ["\nTo begin with RAM-LEELA remains another self-obsessed, colourful but\nover-stuffed painting on the celluloid with some exceptional brush\nstrokes failing to generate any huge impact on the viewer in totality.\nThe film does have its worth watching moments which are mostly to be\nfound in its first half watching the lead pair together doing their\nlusty sexual acts (questionably) portrayed as Eternal LOVE. But post\nintermission it all fizzles out drastically and the director tries to\nadd too many unconvincing twists and turns taking it to an unnerving\nend sadly. No doubt few magical moments do come in at various\nintervals, consolidating the director's famous status in the industry.\nBut regrettably they are not something fresh or path-breaking, since\neither they remind you of a song sequence of his mega hit \"Hum Dil De\nChuke Sanam\" or of a powerful scene of \"Devdas\" giving you a seen\nbefore kind of feel, repeatedly. The soundtrack too is able to impress\nonly partially with a few good tracks in the initial reels and as the\nfilm progresses their excessive use starts becoming annoying,\nparticularly in the second half."], "review_data2": ["\nDisappointing is the word with which I would like to start this review.\nWhen you know it's Romeo and Juliet, when you have seen Isaq and\nIsaqzaade you don't expect any thing exceptional from another movie\nwith more or less the concept,plot and story. But when you see the name\nof Sanjay Leela Bhansali somewhere in your mind you feel may be this\ncould be something different. At least the chemistry between the lead\nwill be worth watching.And that's where, for me,the movie fails\nmiserably. Chemistry is not just about the physical intimacy, it can be\nfelt even when the leads are not sharing the same vicinity, like in the\n\"Lunchbox\". May be I was expecting love but there was only lust with\nlame dialogs. The couple seem to be desperate to get laid and hardly\nwant to know each other. Apart from that there is unnecessary violence.
